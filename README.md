# WebpWhack

Welcome to **WebpWhack**! This handy tool is here to save the day for artists and designers who find themselves stuck with `.webp` images they've downloaded and need them in `.jpeg` format for their creative work. It's perfect for those moments when Photoshop isn't playing nice with `.webp`.

## Features at a Glance

- **Automatic Conversion**: Just drop your `.webp` files into the chosen folder, and watch them transform into `.jpeg` format, ready for your projects.
- **Straightforward UI**: We've kept things simple so you can get up and running in no time. Choose your folder, set it to start with your system if you like, and hit "Start Running".
- **Runs in the Background**: Once started, WebpWhack quietly does its job in the background. Need to make changes? Open the app again, and you're back in control.
- **Smart Operation**: The app knows when to stay active and when to take a break, optimizing its operation based on your workflow.
